A simple game where you collect tokens and avoid monsters.

Goal:

- get to as high a level as possible before getting eaten

Features:

- game engine written from scratch in 4 days
- improvised jazzy music <http://solsort.com/tsar_tnoc/audio/jazzy.ogg>
- original odd graphics
- procedural level generation
- focus was more on prototyping experiment than actual game...
