# Productivity hacks

Notes from presentation.

## Tactical vs strategic thinking
Planning on different levels, frees up focus. Work more efficiently when not thinking about direction.

### Daily review

Review previous day • Think once a day • Choose tasks

### Exercise, food, sleep~dream

Physical prerequisite for persistent performance

### Gratitude, reiterate direction

Daily reaffirm direction • Focus on gratitude

### Pomodoros

25 minute timebox • Atomic units • Task estimation • Record activity • Small, easy to start • Work fit allocated time (¿Parkinsons? law)

### Empty inbox

Frees mental space • clutter tolerance, same amount of work

### Daylog

Todolist • getting things out of the head • moving to done

### Backlog

Temporal backlog in daylog • Categorised backlog in separate file • Capture system

### Review Biweekly and Quarterly

Overall direction • Look back • Review backlog and goals • Temporal backlog

## Sources
### Getting Things Done
Empty inbox • Capture system • Not keeping stuff in the head

### Scrum (and Lean)
14 day sprints • Retrospective • Daily Scrum • Kanban - daylog • Measure and optimise

### Junto
